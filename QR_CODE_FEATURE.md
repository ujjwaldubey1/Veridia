# 🎯 QR Code Verification Feature

## ✅ Implementation Complete

Your Veridia Land Registry now includes a **QR Code verification system** that allows anyone to verify land ownership on the blockchain without needing a wallet or account.

## 🚀 How It Works

### **1. After Registration:**

When a land is successfully registered on the blockchain:

- The transaction completes
- A modal automatically opens with a **unique QR code**
- The QR code contains all verification data

### **2. What's in the QR Code:**

- **Land ID**: Unique identifier
- **Owner Address**: Blockchain address of the owner
- **Jurisdiction**: Location/jurisdiction
- **Metadata Hash**: IPFS document hash
- **Contract Address**: Smart contract address
- **Transaction Hash**: Link to blockchain explorer
- **Timestamp**: Registration time

### **3. Verifying Land Ownership:**

#### **Option A: Scan QR Code**

1. Anyone can scan the QR code with their phone camera or QR scanner app
2. They get redirected to `/verify` page
3. The page automatically verifies ownership on the Aptos blockchain
4. Shows green checkmark ✅ if verified, red ❌ if failed

#### **Option B: Share Verification URL**

1. Click "Copy Verification URL" button
2. Share the URL directly
3. Recipient clicks the link
4. Automatic verification happens

#### **Option C: Download QR Code**

1. Click "Download QR Code"
2. Save as PNG image
3. Share via email, print, or messaging apps
4. Anyone can scan it later to verify

## 📱 Mobile Testing

1. Make sure your phone and computer are on the same network
2. Find your computer's local IP (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
3. Access `http://192.168.1.100:5173/` from your phone
4. Scan the QR code
5. Verification page loads and checks blockchain

## 🌐 Production Deployment

For production use:

1. **Update base URL** in QR code generation:

   ```typescript
   const url = `https://your-domain.com/verify?data=${encoded}`
   ```

2. **Update API endpoint** in VerifyLand.tsx:
   ```typescript
   const response = await fetch('https://mainnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/view', ...)
   ```
