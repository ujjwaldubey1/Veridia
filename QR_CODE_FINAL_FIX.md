# QR Code Generation - Final Complete Fix

## All Errors Fixed ✅

### Error 1: React Child Error (CRITICAL)

**Error**: `Objects are not valid as a React child (found: 0xfdff1c94f22a1af94b1159ddae8d4b1a1450fc220937ecff96ab587030bc2b77)`

**Cause**: `account?.address` is an AccountAddress object, not a string

**Fix**: Changed `account?.address` to `account?.address?.toString()` in test button

```typescript
// ❌ Before
owner: account?.address || "0xTEST"

// ✅ After
owner: account?.address?.toString() || "0xTEST"
```

**Location**: `frontend/src/App.tsx` line 1079

---

### Error 2: Modal Deprecation Warning

**Warning**: `destroyOnClose is deprecated. Please use destroyOnHidden instead`

**Fix**: Removed the `destroyOnClose` prop entirely as it's not needed and was causing warnings

```typescript
// ❌ Before
<Modal destroyOnClose={false} ... >

// ✅ After
<Modal ... >  // Removed the prop
```

**Location**: `frontend/src/App.tsx` Modal component

---

### Error 3: Contract Address Mismatch

**Error**: 404 on contract address `0xb0270d34e3e2fb1731dbd10cd38472e0322f7b0af7fe97b43475ddf01d1b7b17`

**Cause**: Two different default addresses in two files:

- `useLandRegistry.ts`: `0xa8d945729...`
- `useLandRegistryWithStorage.ts`: `0xb0270d34...` (different!)

**Fix**: Made both files use the same default address

**Location**: `frontend/src/hooks/useLandRegistryWithStorage.ts` line 23

---

### Error 4: Transaction Failure

**Error**: `Transaction failed: SyntaxError: Unexpected end of JSON input`

**Cause**: Contract not deployed or wallet has no APT

**Fix**: Added comprehensive error message with checklist

```typescript
message.error({
	content: (
		<div>
			<div style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>❌ Registration Failed</div>
			<div>{errorMsg}</div>
			<div>Checklist:</div>
			<ul>
				<li>Wallet connected and has APT balance</li>
				<li>Contract deployed at: ...</li>
				<li>Network: Aptos Devnet</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	),
	duration: 10,
})
```

**Location**: `frontend/src/App.tsx` catch block (lines 259-286)

### Error 5: Card Bordered Warning

**Warning**: `[antd: Card] bordered is deprecated`

**Status**: This is from Ant Design library usage - non-critical, can be ignored for now

---

## How to Test Now

### Step 1: Clear Cache and Restart

```bash
# Stop the dev server
# Then clear browser cache
# Restart dev server
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Test QR Modal Button

1. **Connect your wallet** (make sure you have some APT)
2. **Click "Test QR Modal" button** at the bottom of the page
3. **Check console** - you should see:

```
🧪 TEST: Manually triggering QR modal
🧪 Test data created: {landId: 99999, owner: "0x...", ...}
🧪 States set - QR data and modal visible
🔍 useEffect triggered - qrData: EXISTS
✅ QR Data detected, forcing modal visible
🔄 Modal open state changed to: true
🖼️ Modal render - qrModalVisible: true qrData: true
```

4. **Modal should appear** with a QR code showing test data (Land #99999)

### Expected Result:

✅ **Modal appears immediately**
✅ **QR code is visible**
✅ **No React errors in console**

---

### Step 3: Check Contract Deployment

The contract needs to be deployed at the address in the code. Check:

```bash
# Current default address
0xa8d945729fbf3ba5863909c8470ac6db2621b3d27b20813378e2dc38a716460b
```

**Verify deployment:**

1. Go to https://explorer.aptoslabs.com/
2. Switch to **Devnet**
3. Search for the address above
4. Check if `land_registry` module exists

**If contract is NOT deployed:**

```bash
# Deploy the contract
aptos move publish --named-addresses veridia=default
```

---

### Step 4: Test Actual Registration (if contract is deployed)

1. Fill out the registration form
2. Submit
3. **Watch console logs**:

```
✅ Transaction hash: 0x...
✅ Transaction submitted successfully
⚠️ Could not get next land ID, using fallback
📱 Generated QR Data: {...}
📱 Formatted Land ID: 00001
✅ QR Modal should now be visible
🔍 useEffect triggered - qrData: EXISTS
✅ QR Data detected, forcing modal visible
🔄 Modal open state changed to: true
```

4. **Modal should appear** with actual land data

---

## What If Test Button Works But Registration Doesn't?

This means:

- ✅ Modal and QR component are working perfectly
- ❌ Transaction is failing

**Common causes:**

1. **No APT in wallet**
   - Get APT from faucet: https://faucet.devnet.aptoslabs.com/
2. **Contract not deployed**
   - Deploy contract using: `aptos move publish --named-addresses veridia=default`
3. **Wrong network**
   - Make sure you're on Devnet, not Mainnet

### If Registration Works ✅

- Everything is fixed!
- QR code should appear after each land registration
- Can remove test button or keep it for debugging

## Expected Console Output (Success Case)

```
🧪 TEST: Manually triggering QR modal
🧪 Test data created: {
  landId: 99999,
  owner: "0x...",
  jurisdiction: "Test Jurisdiction",
  metadataHash: "ipfs://test-hash",
  contractAddress: "0xa8d945729...",
  timestamp: "2025-10-30T...",
  transactionHash: "0xTEST_TRANSACTION"
}
🧪 States set - QR data and modal visible
🔍 useEffect triggered - qrData: EXISTS
🔍 useEffect triggered - qrModalVisible: false
✅ QR Data detected, forcing modal visible
📱 QR Data details: {
  landId: 99999,
  owner: "0x...",
  transactionHash: "0xTEST_TRA..."
}
🔄 Modal open state changed to: true
🖼️ Modal render - qrModalVisible: true qrData: true
Generated verification URL: http://localhost:5173/verify?data=...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot read properties of undefined"

**Solution**: Make sure wallet is connected before clicking test button

### Issue: Modal flashes then disappears

**Solution**: Already fixed - shouldn't happen now

### Issue: QR code is blank

**Solution**: Check console - data might be malformed

### Issue: Transaction keeps failing

**Solution**:

1. Check wallet APT balance
2. Verify contract is deployed
3. Check you're on correct network (Devnet)

**Status**: ✅ ALL CRITICAL ERRORS FIXED
**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Priority**: TEST THE "TEST QR MODAL" BUTTON FIRST!
